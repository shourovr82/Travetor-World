Relational databases accessed with SQL (Structured Query Language) were developed in the 1970s with a focus on reducing data duplication as storage was much more costly than developer time. SQL databases tend to have rigid, complex, tabular schemas and typically require expensive vertical scaling.</p>

                <div className="flex-grow">
                  <p className="leading-relaxed text-white font-mono">JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share information between two parties securely — a client and a server. In most cases, it’s an encoded JSON containing a set of claims and a signature. It’s usually used in the context of other authentication mechanisms like OAuth, OpenID to share user-related information. It’s also a popular way to authenticate/authorize users in a microservice architecture.

                    JWT authentication is a token-based stateless authentication mechanism. It is popularly used as a client-side-based stateless session, this means the server doesn’t have to completely rely on a data store (or) database to save session information.

                    JWTs can be encrypted, but they are typically encoded & signed.  We will be focusing on Signed JWTs. The purpose of Signed JWT is not to hide the data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. And that is why it’s highly recommended to use HTTPS with Signed JWTs.</p>

                </div>
                <div className="flex-grow">
                  <p className="leading-relaxed text-white font-mono">NodeJS Web Server maintains a limited Thread Pool to provide services to client requests. Multiple clients make multiple requests to the NodeJS server. NodeJS receives these requests and places them into the EventQueue .
                    NodeJS server has an internal component referred to as the EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them. This EventLoop is single threaded. In other words, EventLoop is the listener for the EventQueue.
                    So, we have an event queue where the requests are being placed and we have an event loop listening to these requests in the event queue. What happens next?
                    The listener(the event loop) processes the request and if it is able to process the request without needing any blocking IO operations, then the event loop would itself process the request and sends the response back to the client by itself.
                    If the current request uses blocking IO operations, the event loop sees whether there are threads available in the thread pool, picks up one thread from the thread pool and assigns the particular request to the picked thread. That thread does the blocking IO operations and sends the response back to the event loop and once the response gets to the event loop, the event loop sends the response back to the client.</p>
